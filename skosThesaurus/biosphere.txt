Notes:

#1 Workshop

A first draft of the terrestrial part of the biosphere vocbulary was presented
to the participants  They discussed the contents and refined the structure and.

Paper:
	* Woodward et al. (2004)



#2 Workshop

A first draft of the water related part of the biosphere vocabulary was
presented to the participants. Pier suggested to use a slice of ENVO. Thus the
participants created a mapping between the biosphere vocabulary concepts and
ENVO

			Aquatic Biomes
				o abb:

                                       freshwater and marine which differ by their content of salt.
                                       Where fresh and salt water mixes we get brackish water which offers a
                                       niche for specially adapted organisms. The main factors influencing the
                                       aquatic biomes are the salinity, the tides, currents and light availability as
                                       well as the light quality.
