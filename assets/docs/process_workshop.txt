	formed by members of the GFBio project and other related collaborators.

#2 Workshop

* Books
	+ Wörterbuch der Ökologie (Mattias Schaefer, ISBN: 978-3-8274-2561-4)

* Notes

	+ Time Scale, Organization Scale, Spatial Scale have been identified to be
	  more general concepts. The group argued that this needs to go into an own
	  top level dimension

		I argue that a derived form of these base dimensions is important to keep in
		the process facet for more semantically more powerful assertions about
		processes. Thus I added Process Time Scale, Process Organization Scale and
		Process Spatial Scale.


	=> Update:
		Further Discussions with Mario and David convinced me to put the scales aside.
		They are important for the processes but rather represent descriptive information
		about the process (metadata) if we use them in their derived process specific version.
		This information is highly valuable but might be hard to provide by the person
		tagging the data as either the information is missing yet or incomplete (e.g. Which
		organizational levels does a process act on, or which time does it take to
		develop visible impacts on parts of the ecosystem in general.)

* Agreements/Changelog

	+ The Process Type and the cycle type need to be merged as the represent together
	  important process types. (check)

		=> Now cycles appear in the list of process instances!

	+ The concept of Service type does not fit well enough. We rather call it Process
	  identity (check)

		=> Restructured the vocabulary to make the identity broader not it fits

	+ While the Transport processes types are intuitive the transformation process types
	  are not. They have to be refined. (check)

		=> have been reworked according to the workshop discussions
			(Addition [A] -> [AB] , Removal [AB] -> [A], Increase (a -> A), Decrease (A -> a), Transition (A -> B), Conversion (AB <-> B + A))

	+ In Process Agents, the Agent implies an active participant or driver of the process
	  this does not all the sub-categories e.g. chemicals or spheres. This needs rework (check)

		=> Now this is called "Process Component" to get rid of the implication of an active
		   participation

	+ A list of processes needs to be accessible as well. The group was collecting instances
	  of processes in a top 20 list. This will be implemented as free field with auto completion
	  in the tagging framework and as a top 20 list to pick from (self sorting by importance) in
	  the faceted search

		=> lists top 20 now and many more below it (these need to be checked, cleaned, described and
		   mapped into the process vocabulary by a student helper.
