Process #{{{

	o imp:
	o des: According to the Elsevier Dictionary of Biology (Tirri et al., 1998) a process
               is defined as a series of events, reactions or operations, achieving a certain
               definite result. Ecosystem processes are seen therefore as the complex
               interactions among biotic and abiotic elements of ecosystems, encompassing in
               broad terms material cycles and the flow of energy (Lyons et al., 2005).
